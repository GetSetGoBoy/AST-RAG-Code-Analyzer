Python: eval() is dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code. Use ast.literal_eval() for safety.
JavaScript: Using .innerHTML can allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use .textContent instead.
Java: Hardcoding passwords in strings is a major security risk. Use Environment Variables or Key Vaults.
C++: The strcpy function does not check buffer limits. Use strncpy to prevent memory crashes.
General: Always rotate secrets and never commit API keys to version control.
